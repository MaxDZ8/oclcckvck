# OpenCL Crypto Currency Kernel Validity ChecK
This project is an M8M spinoff.

Many users report issues with M8M compatibility across drivers or hardware. While those errors are being addressed, there's definitely the need to provide a somewhat insulated testing enviroment. 

The primary goal is to run known input on the OpenCL implementation so eventual pool misconfigurations are out of the picture.

Future releases might also automate performance testing.
